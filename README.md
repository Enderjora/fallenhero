Repo of my abandoned Minecraft map. Included are the resource pack, main world download, and demo world download. Nothing is guaranteed to work.

After working on this project for a couple of years, I have realized that my motivation is gone for good. If that ever changes, I will update the project, but keep it open source.

You are welcome to use any code or assets in any project, personal or public, as long as you credit me.

This repo includes:

The resource pack, which features many 3D models created by myself for enemies, items, and misc. materials inspired by the Legend of Zelda series. NOTE: Included is a music system, with tracks I obtained permission for from the two musicians (credited in the map itself). As I didn't create this music, I will be removing it, which removes some functionality of the map.

A Minecraft map with a couple dungeons and an open world (it is outdated, I honestly don't know what version it will work best in, I believe 1.19) and many datapacks for health, money, dungeon, mob, and item functionality. Some of the code is from other people or other projects, and I have done my best to credit everyone whose code I have used, as well as asking permission where necessary. If you find your code and weren't credited sufficiently, please let me know and I will remove it.

The above datapacks in their own ZIP file (note: some commands are coordinate specific).

A Minecraft map with one large unfinished dungeon.

Feel free to reach out to me on Discord (Enderjora) with any questions or comments.
